# Svelte Markdown Editor
An Electron application example using Svelte components to create a Markdown Editor.


## Getting Started

1. `cd` into the `/app` directory and run `npm install` or `yarn`.
2. Once complete you can run `npm run start` from the `/app` directory to launch the application.

The application is built using the [bluma](bulma.io) framework. You can run `gulp sass` or `npm run build-styles` to compile the `main.sass` file.

## Adding / Editing components

After making changes to a component or adding a new one you'll need to run `npm run build-components` from the `/app` directory.
